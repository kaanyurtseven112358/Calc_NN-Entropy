# Calc_NN-Entropy
This code optimizes the parameters of a quantum circuit in order to maximize the difference between the probabilities of obtaining the states |00> and |11> when the circuit is run. The quantum circuit consists of a sequence of rotation gates around the X and Y axes, and a pair of controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates.
The optimization is performed using gradient descent, which updates the parameters at each optimization step in the direction that maximizes the cost function. The cost function is defined as the difference between the probabilities of obtaining the states |00> and |11>, which are computed using PennyLane's probs function.
After the optimization is completed, the final probability distribution is printed. This probability distribution represents the probability of obtaining each possible state when the optimized quantum circuit is run.
The output of this code will depend on the initial values of the parameters and the optimization process. However, in general, the probability of obtaining the state |00> should be higher, and the probability of obtaining the state |11> should be lower, compared to the probabilities obtained before the optimization.
